## 📌 Overview

**Usability Engineering** is a user-centered approach to designing interactive systems that are **easy to learn**, **efficient to use**, and **satisfying** for users. It focuses on understanding user needs, tasks, and environments, and applying systematic methods to improve the overall **User Experience (UX)**.

This discipline is widely used in:
- 💻 Software Engineering
- 📱 Web & Mobile Application Development
- 🖥️ Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)
- 🎨 Product Design

## 🎯 Objectives

The main goals of Usability Engineering are:

| Objective | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎯 **Effectiveness & Efficiency** | Improve system performance and user productivity |
| ❌ **Error Reduction** | Reduce user errors and learning time |
| 😊 **User Satisfaction** | Increase overall user satisfaction |
| ♿ **Accessibility** | Ensure accessibility and inclusiveness |
| 🎪 **User-Centered** | Design systems that match real user needs |

    C --> D[🧪 Usability Testing]
    D --> E[📊 Evaluation & Iteration]
    E --> C
```

### Process Steps

1. **👥 User Research**
   - Identify users, goals, and context
   - Conduct user interviews and observations

2. **📋 Requirement Analysis**
   - Define usability requirements
   - Establish success criteria

3. **🎨 Design & Prototyping**
   - Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **🧪 Usability Testing**
   - Test with real users
   - Gather qualitative and quantitative data

5. **📊 Evaluation & Iteration**
   - Analyze results and improve design
   - Refine based on insights

## 🛠 Common Usability Methods

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 🔍 **Heuristic Evaluation** | Expert review based on usability principles | Early design stages |
| 👥 **Usability Testing** | Observing users complete tasks | Any stage of development |
| 📝 **Surveys & Questionnaires** | Collecting user feedback at scale | Post-launch or beta testing |
| 🎭 **Personas & User Scenarios** | Creating representative user profiles | Planning and design phases |
| 🔬 **A/B Testing** | Comparing two versions | Optimizing existing features |
| 🚶 **Cognitive Walkthroughs** | Step-by-step task analysis | Evaluating task flows |

---

## 📊 Usability Metrics

Track and measure usability with these key metrics:

- ✅ **Task Completion Rate** - Percentage of successfully completed tasks
- ⏱️ **Time on Task** - Time required to complete specific tasks
- ⚠️ **Error Rate** - Frequency of user errors
- 📚 **Learnability** - How quickly users can accomplish tasks
- 😊 **User Satisfaction** - Measured using SUS (System Usability Scale)

---

## 🌍 Applications

Usability Engineering principles are applied across various domains:

- 🌐 **Web & Mobile Applications** - E-commerce, social media, productivity apps
- 🏢 **Enterprise Software** - CRM, ERP, project management tools
- 🛒 **E-commerce Platforms** - Shopping carts, checkout flows, product pages
