Usability Engineering
📌 Overview

Usability Engineering is a user-centered approach to designing interactive systems that are easy to learn, efficient to use, and satisfying for users. It focuses on understanding user needs, tasks, and environments, and applying systematic methods to improve the overall user experience (UX).

This discipline is widely used in software engineering, web and mobile application development, human–computer interaction (HCI), and product design.

🎯 Objectives

The main goals of Usability Engineering are:

Improve effectiveness and efficiency of systems

Reduce user errors and learning time

Increase user satisfaction

Ensure accessibility and inclusiveness

Design systems that match real user needs

🧩 Key Principles

User-Centered Design (UCD) – Design based on user needs and feedback

Consistency – Similar actions should produce similar results

Simplicity – Minimize complexity and cognitive load

Feedback – Inform users about system status and actions

Error Prevention & Recovery – Prevent errors and help users recover easily
